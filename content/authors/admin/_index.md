# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am generally interested in deep learning algorithms for computer vision. I have been involved in the development of projects on Image classification, Sketch-Based Image Retrieval, Data-Efficient Training, and Semantic segmentation. I am currently working on training ViT models data efficiently and also on Sketch-Based Image Retrieval problems.

I’m a Final-year Electronics and Computer Engineering undergraduate student at [Thapar University, Patiala, India](http://www.thapar.edu/). My research focus is broadly centered around **Computer Vision** and **Deep Learning**. I work on research projects dealing with Generative Adversarial Networks, Knowledge Distillation, and zero-shot classification. I intend to explore the neural networks under the low-resource training data scenario using **Knowledge Distillation** and and the **Efficient Subset selection** paradigm.

I have currently working as a **Research Intern** at UiT Norway. In the past, I have worked also in NVIDIA, and SketchX as **Research Intern**. I have also worked as a part-time Research Engineer at a startup, Minus Zero, where I worked on an autonomous electric car with level 5 autonomy.
