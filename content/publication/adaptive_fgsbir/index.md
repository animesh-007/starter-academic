abstract: "The recent focus on Fine-Grained Sketch-Based Image Re-
trieval (FG-SBIR) has shifted towards generalising a model to new cat-
egories without any training data from them. In real-world applications,
however, a trained FG-SBIR model is often applied to both new cate-
gories and different human sketchers, i.e., different drawing styles. Al-
though this complicates the generalisation problem, fortunately, a hand-
ful of examples are typically available, enabling the model to adapt to the
new category/style. In this paper, we offer a novel perspective â€“ instead
of asking for a model that generalises, we advocate for one that quickly
adapts, with just very few samples during testing (in a few-shot manner).
To solve this new problem, we introduce a novel model-agnostic meta-
learning (MAML) based framework with several key modifications: (1)
As a retrieval task with a margin-based contrastive loss, we simplify the
MAML training in the inner loop to make it more stable and tractable.
(2) The margin in our contrastive loss is also meta-learned with the rest
of the model. (3) Three additional regularisation losses are introduced in
the outer loop, to make the meta-learned FG-SBIR model more effective
for category/style adaptation. Extensive experiments on public datasets
suggest a large gain over generalisation and zero-shot based approaches,
and a few strong few-shot baselines."
