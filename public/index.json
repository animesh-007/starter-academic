[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"I’m a Final-year Electronics and Computer Engineering undergraduate student at Thapar University, Patiala, India. My research focus is broadly centered around Computer Vision and Deep Learning. I work on research projects dealing with Generative Adversarial Networks, Knowledge Distillation, and zero-shot classification. I intend to explore the neural networks under the low-resource training data scenario using Knowledge Distillation and and the Efficient Subset selection paradigm.\nI have currently working as a Research Intern at UiT Norway. In the past, I have worked also in NVIDIA, and SketchX as Research Intern. I have also worked as a part-time Research Engineer at a startup, Minus Zero, where I worked on an autonomous electric car with level 5 autonomy.\nNews [July 2022] Adaptive Fine-Grained Sketch-Based Image Retrieval is accpeted in the ECCV 2022.
